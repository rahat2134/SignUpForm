Certainly! In the context of React, event handlers are functions that are called in response to events triggered by user interaction or other actions. In the provided code, there are two event handlers:

1. **handleChange**:
   ```jsx
   const handleChange = (e) => {
     const { name, value } = e.target;
     setFormData({ ...formData, [name]: value });
   };
   ```
   This event handler is responsible for updating the form data whenever the user types something into an input field. It is attached to the `onChange` event of each input field. Here's a breakdown of how it works:
   - `(e)` is the event object passed automatically to event handler functions in React.
   - `e.target` refers to the element that triggered the event, in this case, the input field.
   - `name` and `value` are extracted from the input field using destructuring. `name` represents the name attribute of the input field, and `value` represents the current value entered by the user.
   - `setFormData({ ...formData, [name]: value })` updates the `formData` state by creating a new object with all existing form data (`...formData`) and updating the property corresponding to the `name` of the input field with the new `value`.

2. **handleSubmit**:
   ```jsx
   const handleSubmit = (e) => {
     e.preventDefault();
     console.log(formData);
   };
   ```
   This event handler is triggered when the user submits the form. It prevents the default form submission behavior (reloading the page) using `e.preventDefault()`, then logs the form data to the console. In a real application, you would typically send this form data to a server for processing, such as creating a new user account.

These event handlers are essential for making the form interactive and for capturing user input and actions to update the application state accordingly.

 The e.preventDefault() method is a crucial part of handling form submissions in React (and JavaScript in general). Let's dive deeper into what it does and why it's used:

Preventing Default Behavior:

When a form is submitted in a web browser, the default behavior is for the page to reload or navigate to a new URL. This behavior is undesirable in many React applications because it interrupts the single-page application (SPA) experience.
